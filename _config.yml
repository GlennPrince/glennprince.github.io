  Hi, I'm Glenn. I am an experienced, pragmatic Solutions Architect that has helped organisations with transformative projects for the last few years. With diverse experience across development and infrastructure, I am passionate about learning new technologies and solving complex problems. I enjoy writing about my experiences and pretending to know how to code.
